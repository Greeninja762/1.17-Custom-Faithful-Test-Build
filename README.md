a repo for my Custom Faithful pack, made out of a 32x faithful pack with some other stuff added in.

yes i may have stolen some assets from other authors, most of them should be listed below:

faithfulteam: for the original pack that i made this out of.

seaofpixels: for some of the animated texture ideas that i had while looking at his amazing pack

My Brother: who made the color pallet that i used to make the diamond items much more blue instead of teal

this pack is tailored mostly to my own interests and wants for when i'm playing vanilla minecraft, but since i got some people asking me about the pack, i figured that a good place for people to download and keep up with it would be on github

if you don't like it, that's fine. I'm making this repo for the people that just happened to be interested.
